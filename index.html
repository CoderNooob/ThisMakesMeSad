    <label style="font-size: 30px;">My information tells me that MobileNet is way better than dumb googleNet, clearlt BYJU just wants us to waste our time doing this project so we will stop thinking about how trash GoogleNet is, like just think of it... Facebook sells your internet on the black market so google probally does that aswell.MobileNet on the other hand is a trusty source which will just identify things and not track you. Also support the small corps not the big eveil ones that genmerate like 1bil every single second like tahts soooo insane!!! Trust me dont trust those crazy big corps saying that they are the best and fairest and cheapest.Google Lens may be glitching out on you or not working because you haven't set it up yet. Android users who have downloaded the Google Lens app need to first set up and activate Lens before they can use it seamlessly. Press and hold the Home button on your device until Google Assistant is pulled up.Why can't I get Google Lens on my phone?
        If Google Lens is missing, try updating the app manually. To do so, open the Google Play Store app. Tap on the Menu button (three dashes) in the top-left corner of the screen. ... If you're not using Google Photos, Android users can download the app from the Google Play Store.Why is MobileNet good?
        As a lightweight deep neural network, MobileNet has fewer parameters and higher classification accuracy. In order to further reduce the number of network parameters and improve the classification accuracy, dense blocks that are proposed in DenseNets are introduced into MobileNet.Please dont make me do this Ms.Geetha PLEASE MS GEETHA THIS SEEMS SO BORING PLEASE AHHHHHHHHHHHHH</label>
